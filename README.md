## ℹ️ Description
• Adds quick action buttons when hovering over videos.  
• Made for homepage, subscriptions, and video pages. Might work elsewhere — idk tho.

## ⚠️ Requirement  
• Video preview is not supported. Disable it @ https://www.youtube.com/account_playback  
• Instead, you can use rich thumbnail where/if available as replacement for video preview. It's a very short looping gif, not as useful but better than none.  
• Be advise that rich thumbnail can expire if you keep the tab open for too long. It will return default gray image instead.  
• English only.

## 🆘 Help & Troubleshooting
• YouTube runs many tests, so what works for me might not work for you—your layout and features might be different.  
• This is a personal script I made for and tailored to myself — just sharing as-is in case it’s useful to others.  
• I don’t provide support or updates unless I run into the issue myself. and cause im noob at this.  
• If it breaks, you can simply uninstall it as it won't be helpful to you anymore 👍  
• It’s unlicensed — feel free to fork it, tweak it, or use it however you like.

## 🦥 Tested on:
• Firefox 137.0.2 (64-bit)  
• Windows 11 23H2 22631.5189
