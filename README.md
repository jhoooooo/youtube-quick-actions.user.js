## ⚠️ Requirement
• Video preview is not supported. Disable it, won’t work with it on.

## 🆘 Help & Troubleshooting
• YouTube runs many tests, so what works for me might not work for you—your layout and features might be different.  
• This is a personal script I made for and tailored to myself — just sharing as-is in case it’s useful to others.  
• I don’t provide support or updates unless I run into the issue myself. and cause im noob at this.  
• If it breaks, you can simply uninstall it as it won't be helpful to you anymore 👍  
• It’s unlicensed — feel free to fork it, tweak it, or use it however you like.
